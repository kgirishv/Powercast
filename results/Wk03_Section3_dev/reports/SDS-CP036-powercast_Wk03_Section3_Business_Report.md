# SDS-CP036-powercast - Week 3 Section 3: Evaluation and Model Interpretation & Insights

## Key Questions Answered

Q: How did you interpret feature importance or model coefficients, and what did they reveal about power consumption drivers?
A: We used **two lenses**:
- **Correlations with weather/solar inputs** (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, diffuse flows) to highlight external drivers of demand.
- **Model internals**: SARIMAX coefficients (strength of autoregression/seasonality) and XGBoost lag importances (which past hours matter most).
Across zones, we typically saw strong daily patterns (lag-24) and meaningful sensitivity to temperature/humidity during daytime hours.

Q: Did you observe any systematic errors or biases in your model predictions? How did you investigate and address them?
A: We examined **residuals by hour-of-day**. Consistent positive or negative bias at certain hours indicates timing or magnitude drift. Where bias was nonâ€‘negligible, we recommend tuning seasonal orders or adding exogenous regressors (e.g., temperature) or holiday indicators to reduce recurring misfit.

Q: What trade-offs did you consider when selecting your final model(s) for each zone?
A: Trade-offs balanced **accuracy vs. simplicity vs. speed**. SARIMAX is easy to explain and fast, but may underfit non-linear spikes; XGBoost captures complex patterns but needs feature care and is heavier. We keep **per-zone** models for clarity and operational accountability.

## Business Value Summary (Executive View)
- **Explainability**: Clear links between demand and weather/time drivers build stakeholder trust.
- **Actionable fixes**: Hour-of-day bias flags when to adjust staffing, procurement, or model features.
- **Right-fit models**: Per-zone choices align model complexity with the operational need and runtime SLAs.
- **Scalable process**: The same interpretation workflow extends as new zones or signals are added.
